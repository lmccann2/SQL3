--    Create a view that returns the following columns: FirstName, MiddleName, LastName, EmailAddress, PhoneNumber, Name (PhoneNumberTypeName).

 

-- You will need to create a SELECT statement inside of a CREATE VIEW statement to join the following tables together:

     

-- [AdventureWorks2012].[Person].[Person]

-- [AdventureWorks2012].[Person].[EmailAddress]

-- [AdventureWorks2012].[Person].[PersonPhone]

-- [AdventureWorks2012].[Person].[PhoneNumberType]

--FirstName, MiddleName, LastName, EmailAddress, PhoneNumber, Name (PhoneNumberTypeName)
USE AdventureWorks2017;

CREATE VIEW [dbo].[contact] AS

      ,c.MiddleName
      ,c.LastName
      ,e.EmailAddress
      ,p.PhoneNumber
      ,n.[Name]

	  FROM  [Person].[Person] c
	  INNER JOIN [Person].[PersonPhone] p

	  INNER JOIN [Person].[EmailAddress] e
	  ON e.[BusinessEntityID] = c.[BusinessEntityID]
	  INNER JOIN [Person].[PhoneNumberType] n
	  ON n.[PhoneNumberTypeID] =p.[PhoneNumberTypeID];

	  GO

--Write a SELECT statement that will use
--the view you just created in question #1
--and order the returned data by LastName

--Create a stored procedure (CREATE PROCEDURE statement)
